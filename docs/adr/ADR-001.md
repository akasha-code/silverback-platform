# ADR-001: Use of Redis Streams

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Redis Streams will be used for event-driven communication between services.

## Decision
All asynchronous communication will initially use Redis Streams with consumer groups.

## Consequences
Simple integration, lightweight setup. May need to migrate to Kafka in the future.
